        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold">History</h2>
        <p class="mt-4">
          The Sun Temple was built in the 19th century by the Scindia family.
          The temple's design is based on the famous Sun Temple at Konark in
          Odisha, featuring a stunning structure and intricately carved walls.
          The temple is constructed in the shape of a chariot with 24 wheels,
          representing the 24 hours of the day.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          The temple stands on a raised platform, with a grand entrance and a
          magnificent idol of the Sun God at the center. Over time, the temple
          has become a significant landmark in Gwalior, known for its religious
          importance as well as its architectural beauty. Every year, thousands
          of devotees visit the temple, especially during festivals like Makar
          Sankranti, when the sunâ€™s rays fall directly on the idol of the Sun
          God.
