          The Tigra Dam was constructed in the 19th century by the Scindia
          rulers of Gwalior. It was built with the purpose of providing water to
          the growing city of Gwalior and its surroundings. The dam is located
          near the Tigra village and is part of the larger water supply network
          for the city.
