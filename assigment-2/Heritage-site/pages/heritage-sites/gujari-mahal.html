        <p class="mt-4">
          The Gujri Mahal is an iconic monument located within the Gwalior Fort.
          Built during the reign of Raja Man Singh Tomar in the 15th century, it
          is a stunning example of Mughal architecture, featuring delicate
          carvings and ornate decorations. The mahal is famously associated with
          the king's love for his queen, Mrignayani, and is a beautiful
          expression of their love and devotion.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold">History</h2>
        <p class="mt-4">
          Gujri Mahal, named after the queen, Mrignayani (also known as Gujri),
          was built by Raja Man Singh Tomar. The story behind the palace is that
          it was constructed as a gesture of love for his queen, who was from a
          modest background and was unable to live in the palace due to her
          lower status. This magnificent palace was built for her, providing a
          grand and beautiful space for her to reside.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          The palace was initially designed as a living space for the queen,
          with intricate carvings and lavish interiors. The architecture
          reflects the grandeur of the Mughal period, with elaborate arches and
          elegant columns. The palace is a testament to the love and reverence
          the king had for his queen, and it remains an important landmark of
          Gwalior's royal history.
