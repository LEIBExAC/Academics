        <p class="mt-4">
          The **Sas Bahu Temple** is an architectural marvel located in the
          Gwalior Fort. It consists of two temples, built in the 11th century,
          dedicated to the Hindu gods. The temple complex is known for its
          intricate carvings and unique architectural style, a fusion of North
          and South Indian styles of temple construction.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold">History</h2>
        <p class="mt-4">
          The Sas Bahu Temple was constructed by King Mahipal, who dedicated the
          temples to his mother and his wife. The name "Sas Bahu" refers to the
          relationship between the two temples, symbolizing the mother (Sas) and
          daughter-in-law (Bahu). These temples are famous for their stunning
          carvings on the walls and pillars, which depict various scenes from
          Hindu mythology.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          Built in the 11th century, the Sas Bahu Temple has stood the test of
          time. The intricately carved images on the temple walls include gods,
          goddesses, and stories from the epic Ramayana and Mahabharata. This
          temple is also known for its rich sculptural details, making it an
          important site for both historical and religious reasons.
