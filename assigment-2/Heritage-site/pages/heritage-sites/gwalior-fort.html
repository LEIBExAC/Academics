        History of Gwalior Fort
      </h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        The Gwalior Fort, constructed in the 8th century, is steeped in history
        and tradition. Its origins date back to the reign of Suraj Sen, a local
        king, who named the fort after the saint Gwalipa, who is said to have
        cured him of a fatal disease. Over the centuries, the fort served as a
        crucial stronghold for numerous dynasties, including the Tomars, who
        enhanced its grandeur with remarkable structures like the
        <a href="./man-singh-palace.html" class="text-blue-400"
          ><em>Man Singh Palace</em></a
        >.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
        The fort has seen many historic events, including its capture by Mughal
        emperor Babur, who praised it as the ‚Äúpearl among fortresses in India.‚Äù
        Today, it stands as a symbol of resilience, blending Hindu and Islamic
        architectural styles and attracting visitors from around the world.
