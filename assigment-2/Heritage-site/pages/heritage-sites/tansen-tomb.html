        <p class="mt-4">
          Tansen's Tomb is one of the most significant and revered landmarks in
          Gwalior, dedicated to the memory of the legendary musician, Tansen. A
          revered figure in Indian classical music, Tansen was one of the nine
          gems in the court of Emperor Akbar. The tomb stands as a tribute to
          his immense contribution to Indian music and culture.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold">History</h2>
        <p class="mt-4">
          Tansen's tomb was built in the late 16th century after his death. The
          tomb is located near the Gwalior Fort and is an important site for
          music lovers, scholars, and history enthusiasts. Tansen was known for
          his melodic compositions and for creating ragas that are still widely
          sung today. His tomb, built by his son, is a fine example of Mughal
          architecture with intricate carvings, beautiful arches, and a serene
          atmosphere that reflects his rich legacy.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          Over the centuries, Tansen's tomb has become a pilgrimage site for
          classical musicians, and every year, a special music festival is held
          in his honor, drawing musicians from across the world.
