          is an important historical and cultural landmark of the region. The
          name "Suraj Kund" translates to "The Reservoir of the Sun," and it is

        <p class="mt-4">
          The construction of Suraj Kund is attributed to Raja Man Singh, a
          prominent ruler of Gwalior. It was built to serve as a water
          reservoir, providing water to the nearby areas, particularly during
          dry spells. The structure has a large circular shape and is surrounded
          by an impressive fortification wall, making it not only a functional
          water source but also an architectural wonder.

          important part of Gwalior's heritage. It is also a popular destination
          for tourists, who visit to admire its historical significance and
